# Bad passwords and the NIST guidelines IN Python

Project Description 
==================== 
Almost every web service you join will require you to come up with a password. But what makes a good password? In June 2017 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published publication 800-63B titled Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management. This publication doesn't tell you what is a good password, but it does have specific rules for what is a bad password.

In this project, you will take a list of user passwords and, using publication 800-63B, you will write code that automatically detects and flags the bad passwords. To complete this project, you need to know how to manipulate strings in pandas DataFrames and be familiar with regular expressions. Before starting this project its recommended that you have following knowledge in Python:

i) Cleaning Data in Python
ii)Natural Language Processing Fundamentals in Python

How to Open notebook.ipynb Project File 
=======================================  

i) Free download and install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download/ based upon your computer's operating system.

ii) After downloading Anaconda, Launch "Jupyter Notebook" from Start Menu -> Anaconda.

iii) Move to the directory on "Jupyter Notebook" where you have stored the .ipynb file.

iv) Double click to open the File on "Jupyter Notebook" software.

v) The Jupyter notebook shall reside under the folder "Bad_passwords_and_the_NIST_guidelines_IN_Python". 
   You can download the Bad_passwords_and_the_NIST_guidelines_IN_Python.zip file and unzip at your favorite location to see the notebook.

vi) The datasets which are used on this project shall reside under the folder Bad_passwords_and_the_NIST_guidelines_IN_Python\_\datasets

vii) All the required images shall reside under folder Bad_passwords_and_the_NIST_guidelines_IN_Python\_\img
